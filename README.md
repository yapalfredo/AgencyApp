# AgencyApp (Under development)
Built in Xamarin (Visual Studio, XAML and C#) <br>
Microsoft Azure for Mobile Services


# IMPORTANT ! ! !
1) Upon launching the project for the first time, it's important that you do this: On your Visual Studio's Solution Explorer, right click on your solution name (in this case it's Solution 'AgencyApp'), click "Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...", click "Updates", then install all available updates (if any)

2) Browse and install "Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client" library.


# NOTE:
The codes are not clean yet as it's still on its early stage. There are a lot of redundancies happening all over. Finishing the basic functionalities of the project is the top priority for now. When everything is in place, then we will start cleaning it up and implement MVVM framework.
